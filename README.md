## What is this?

This project aims to combine calendar and tasks management systems into one.

## How it works?

### Today's and Upcoming tasks

You can view all the tasks that are supposed to be done, started, due today in one place. Rest of the scheduled tasks are displayed in upcoming tasks section. This is the place which serves as the calendar. You can assign time to the task which will also serve as a reminder.

Since, all the scheduled tasks are displayed together at one place, it is easier to know what it is that you have to do next at all times. I don't believe in block scheduling as it is too restrictive to me personally.

### Unscheduled tasks

Rest of the tasks are automatically put into unscheduled section.
